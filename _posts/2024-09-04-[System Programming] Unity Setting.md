### Project Settings, Scene Composition, and Version Control
Binary Mode Challenges: Binary mode complicates version control. Difficult to merge and resolve conflicts due to non-readable files. Practical use limited outside specific performance cases.

### Visible Meta Files: 
Generates .meta files for each asset. Facilitates tracking changes and conflict resolution. Text-based files make it easy to see modifications.

### Hidden Meta Files: 
Unity manages metadata internally. 
Useful for single-user projects but less practical for teams. Potentially unclear in collaborative environments.

### Perforce (Helix Core):
Suitable for large projects. Offers file locking and efficient bandwidth use. Helps prevent simultaneous edits and manage large files effectively.

### Efficient Scene Composition
Focus on reducing lag during game start. Optimize loading sequences for smoother player experience. Review existing projects to improve loading efficiency.
